                                        In CSP, I modified an app in App Inventor 
                                        called PaintPot. PaintPot is a drawing app
                                        that allows the user to draw something on 
                                        a screen with the touch of a finger. Before, 
                                        the app only included 3 colors, Red, Blue, and Green.
                                        We wanted to expand the range of colors used
                                        so we made 4 more colors, Pink, Orange, Black,
                                        and Yellow. Next, we wanted to add more strokes
                                        for the lines to provide more variety in the
                                        art created by the user. This proved to be a difficult
                                        task because it was hard to change the actual 
                                        look of the line, so we just made a slider to
                                        allow the user to choose the thickness of the line 
                                        that they want to draw with.

                                        In CSP, I created a game using scratch,and
                                        it's objective was to get a ball, to the other 
                                        side of the map without touching the ground.
                                        The ball would gain more altitude by touching
                                        the platforms, and if the ball misses the plaform
                                        it would plummet straight to the ground and the user
                                        will start from the first level again until 
                                        they reach the end of the level. The coding 
                                        for the game was fairly easy, but there were a few 
                                        issues. It was difficult to program the ball to gain 
                                        altitude after touching the platforms, but I managed
                                        to make it work by making new variables in the code.
