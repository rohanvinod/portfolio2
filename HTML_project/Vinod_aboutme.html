            <p>Hi, my name is Rohan Vinod and I am 14 years old. I am in 9th grade 
            and I go to Dublin High School. I have been very facinated with technology
            and the software that is operating within them. I first got introduced
            to technology by my father, who is a software engineer at Google. I 
            like to do many things in my free time such as exploring the web and figuring
            out how
            it works. Also like to play basketball and code in
            my free time. I also enjoy playing tennis with my friends and socializing
            with others. One of my goals is to join a sports team in dublin high
            and take part in social events. I like to go to school. My favorite subject is P.E because I get to play a lot of fun
            games an socialize with others. I also like math. I like to learn 
            new and exiting ways of solving equations, and finding the values of angles.
            Computer science is a very intresting class that I take and it allows me
            to learn more about how computers work. Though I am a beginner at coding,
            I can still have fun and learn in the process. I have learned a lot from this class
            and will continue learning more about technology for years to come.</p>
